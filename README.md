# Decentralized Medical Equipment Maintenance Network

## Overview

This blockchain-based platform creates a decentralized network for managing medical equipment maintenance across healthcare facilities. The system ensures proper equipment upkeep, technician qualification verification, and parts inventory managementâ€”all critical components for patient safety and operational efficiency in healthcare settings.

The network operates through four specialized smart contracts:

1. **Device Registration Contract**: Records details of hospital equipment
2. **Technician Verification Contract**: Validates qualifications for specific devices
3. **Service Scheduling Contract**: Manages regular maintenance appointments
4. **Parts Inventory Contract**: Tracks availability of replacement components

## Key Features

- **Equipment Lifecycle Tracking**: Comprehensive maintenance history for each device
- **Qualified Technician Matching**: Ensures only properly certified personnel service equipment
- **Automated Scheduling**: Proactive maintenance planning based on manufacturer specifications
- **Real-time Parts Management**: Visibility into component availability and supply chain
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Documentation for audit requirements and safety standards
- **Interoperability**: Works across healthcare facilities regardless of size or location
